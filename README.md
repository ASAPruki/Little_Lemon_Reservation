This website is just a demonstration of the structure of an online reservation website for a fictional restaurant called Little Lemon.
Some pages on this website may only be for visual representation and might not function as they were intended to.
The most important page in this project is the Reservation page.
Also the provided API that I intended to work with is not functional and blocked by the organization itself, so I hard coded it inside the Reservation page.
